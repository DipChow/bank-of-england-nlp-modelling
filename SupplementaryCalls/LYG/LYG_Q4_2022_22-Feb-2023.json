Thanks for the helpful comments in terms of stabilization and never below 300 basis points. But if we think about the different building blocks, it does feel like the second half of the year should be fairly constructive. I say that because the hit you get from liability spreads compression maybe is more front-end loaded, given when rate hikes came through. Mortgage spread churn, I think you talked about 8 basis points in the final quarter. I would assume that starts to get less over the course of the year, whereas the structural hedge tailwind starts -- it continues the year, and actually given the maturity profile you talked to, suggest it could be quite back-end loaded. So I just wondered whether it could be even slightly better than stable once we've rebased in -- over the first half of the year as we think about Q3 and Q4? Or am I getting too optimistic in some of my assumptions around that?"

That, in turn, leads us to have lesser lag benefits versus what we have seen, particularly in the back half of 2022.

Most of that is back-end loaded, i.e., it goes on in quarter 3 and quarter 4 of the year. What that means for the margin is that we expect the margin to be actually pretty healthy in Q1, but we expect these headwinds and tailwinds to play out very much in the course of quarter 2 and therefore, to land in a pretty sustainable place actually, for quarter 2, quarter 3, quarter 4, through the course of '23, in line with my comment earlier on about not falling below the 300 mark.

One is we flagged at Q3 that we expect to see short-term placements come out of the system during the course of Q4. And indeed, that is what we saw. It was pretty much in line with our expectations. The second is that we manage the commercial book, just as we do all books really, but the commercial book in a commercial way. That is to say management pricing actions are part of the story.

And actually, that's exactly what we saw, and we talked about last year that the vast majority of our customers by number, not by value. have actually really quite small deposits and savings balances. And so the real sensitivity doesn't kick in into about a 3% base rate. And that's what we saw happening in kind of Q4 last year.

That includes churn out of current accounts at almost 0% rates as well as customers putting money into time deposits and various saving building products. But for us, as you know, will pay 3% to 5%.

It's being finalized, but our expectation is that, that comes in south of GBP2 billion, below GBP2 billion. That's off the back of considerable contributions, as you know, over the course of the last 2 or 3 years, including in 2022. It's off the back of asset performance on the back of the rate changes that we've seen. But again, we are very confident that it comes in below GBP2 billion. What does that mean?

And looking at the asset side of the balance sheet, I can't have been worried about the pace at which you're seeing some of these trends play through. So if you look at your mortgage book, the back book churn is 25% on the SVR book. Can you talk to us a little bit about what you expect there going forward? When we look at your completion margin was only averaging 50 basis points. And if you look at some of the pricing trends so far in Q1, I mean, there's a Halifax product, which is only 20 basis points above the 5-year swap rate.

I feel -- I think we flagged it quite well last year and indeed through the course of 2022. So the way that's playing out is a little surprise in the sense that we took a lot of products that was add margins of anywhere between 150 to 200 basis points written during the course of, again, '19, '20, '21 which is now evolving or rather refinancing in the context of spreads that are, as we discussed today, 50 basis points on average Q4. I'll come back to that in a little more detail. But nonetheless, the thematic of that unwind is not a surprise. I think what is slightly accentuated versus where we sat here when we sat here last February, is completion margins are below our 75 to 100 basis points range. And so it's refinancing into a slightly tougher yield environment on mortgages. And that's true. And we talked last year about a mortgage headwind of somewhere between GBP1 billion to GBP2 billion playing out over the course of a couple of years. That number now looks a shade above the GBP2 billion. As we play out in 2023 and in 2024. So you can see circa GBP1 billion a year by over illustration. ."

One is it's very natural to expect some of that in the context of a rising rate environment, you do indeed get some customers who want to refinance on to new fixed rate deals. And indeed, we are playing our part and encouraging that via communications to those customers and indeed facilitating product transfers. So we are very much staying in that relationship and we see it as part of our customer duty to ensure that customers are aware of and able to switch where they see it as appropriate. So that back book churn has increased as a percentage. The second point I was going to make there, Raul, is part of the reason why it increases then in some cases, as the balance is being refinanced and not changing that much. What you're getting is a lower and lower denominator. The back book is shrinking in size, so a given chunk of refinancing represents a bigger percentage of that size. As a result, you're seeing a little bit of an uptick in terms of refinancing loads, but not as much as the percentage numbers might sometimes suggest. So that's going on. Again, that's expected. In some respects, it's welcome. We seek to remain in those customer relationships. And more importantly, it's built into the margin guidance we've given you. You asked about completion margins 50 basis points there's quite a dynamic going on there that's worth spending a moment on."

We felt that it was our duty to still be there. As a result, we were operating in an environment of highly volatile and elevated swap levels, compressing mortgage margins. Because of our competitors coming out of the market, we also took quite significant volumes during that time. What that meant was that if you look at the overall completion margin within Q4, you've got an outsized contribution from that October event, but the spread of new business margins in particular in November and December were much more favorable the trouble was, as you know, the volumes are much larger in that time. So our overall 50 basis points for Q4 includes an outsized contribution from October, but then lower contributions are much more favorable margins in November and December. And as we see that dynamic evolve into the first part of this year, Raul, we are seeing new business application margins in the 80 basis point type levels that have been talked about in the market. So we are seeing a favorable development of new business application margins in the course of a last couple of months Q4; and b, first month of this year."

When you see those product transfer customers, customers that we know decent asset quality opportunity to extend the relationship. We are prepared to take a slightly lower margin off the back of that customer product transfer opportunity because of those factors. And that will influence our margin a little bit over the course of the year. And again, that's partly responsible for our margin expectation being below that 75 to 100 basis points corridor.

No. The GBP425 million that we put at the tail end of last year was out of the capital that we generated in '22, not out of the capital that we will be generating in '23. So the circa 175 is after all of what we've done in terms of the GBP2.25 billion that we put in, in 2022, and we start again.

    "text": "Yes. Thanks. Thanks, [indiscernible]. We deliberately spent a bit of time on TNAV in the comments that I made, as you can tell. What did we see during the course of 2022 a number of factors, the buildup from attributable profit, of course, which was welcome. But at the same time, pension surplus slightly changing shape, hit it. The cash flow hedge reserve declining, are you going into negative territory off the back of rising rates, again, hit it. When you add to that, the impact of dividends and other distributions, there was a further impact again on TNAV. You then get the start point being adjusted by IFRS 17. So that's the start point, which we haven't given precise numbers on the IFRS 17 today, but you get the direction, I think, from the appendices to the presentation that we put out you're looking at a start point around 46, 47p type territory. We then see significant build in the factors that I mentioned earlier on. The adjustment in rates starts to lift the cash flow hedge reserve. The business growth that we expect to see starts to build capital within the business, again, lifting the cash flow hedge reserve. The pension surplus builds. Likewise, the buyback when we distribute excess capital, we'll build the TNAV per share. Those factors are going to lead, as I said in my comments, to positive and material developments within TNAV. And although I'm not going to comment on consensus in quite the way that Jonathan would like, we are putting the comments into my script on TNAV for a reason. It is not necessarily going to make up all the difference between what some people see as content for IoT and what we're projecting for 2023, to be clear. But nonetheless, it closes some of the gap. And so we're putting the tenor comment in for a reason."

Having said that, as I said in my comments earlier on, compared to the data that we had when we struck the economic assumptions at Q4, the data that we've had in since then during the course of January has been a little bit more positive at a general macro level.

We have GBP35 billion of maturities in the structural hedge in '23, we have GBP41 billion of maturities in the structural hedge in 2024. We then have ongoing maturities of the structural hedge well into the 40s in the years thereafter. The cumulative impact of that on our net interest income is considerable. And it doesn't much matter whether rates are or . Whatever they might be at that year, it is still considerable because the current yield that we get on the structural hedge is 1.13%. So it does not take much to build in considerable tailwinds to your income developments in the years thereafter. And as you get closer to 2026, they become increasingly powerful."

That plays itself out by the time we get to '24, '25, '26. And then we see the cost base developing in a similar sort of way to the way that we've described to you before. That is to say we get past our investment peak number one. We see the benefit of some of the strategic investments cost saves, paying themselves through number 2. And allied to the BAU cost saves that we see, we see operating leverage within the business rise by which I mean those positive income trends allied to some of the savings that we're continuing to make on an ongoing basis and a cost base starts to build significant operating leverage within the business. That gives us high conviction in the expectation that ROTE in 2025 starts to build to the excess of 15% that we portrayed by '26. So hopefully, that answers the question."

Can you confirm that kind of quantum step off? And can you help us just apportion exactly what's coming from mortgages versus a deposit catch up?

It really just is the -- again, the macroeconomics that we have portrayed there.

And yes, there is a solid step off for a better word, between Q1 to Q2. precisely what that will be, it depends upon how things play out including current pricing in the market, what will mortgage spreads be as we refinance a large part of the book.

When we look at what assets we finance on the balance sheet versus what assets we finance off the balance sheet, there are occasionally opportunities to grab value, if you like, from taking assets off the balance sheet and refinancing them into the capital markets. That is a practice, which, as you know, we've long undertaken within the commercial business as we sought to manage what we described before as the tale of the commercial business, are there ways in which we can enhance value for the business and ultimately, shareholders by taking business into capital markets versus financing it with all of the regulatory capital charges that we get on balance sheet."

And the second question is, it seems sort of strange, I guess, at the moment, but I'd like to ask about costs.

And I guess the background is we've rather lost sight of the digital new entrants year the last year as everybody has made a fortune on NII. But they're still banging away in the background, and then talking 30%, 40% returns on equity. They're all massively deposit long. They're all now producing some pretty extraordinary offers and delivering of margins that I suspect you would really struggle to compete with.

Stage 3 balances, as you know, have been very consistent actually through the course of the year. So Stage Street balances, we had GBP10.75 billion at the end of the year that's versus GBP11.4 million thereabouts in September. Interestingly enough, state balance is, therefore, going down during this time. And actually, if you look back at them after the 1st of January 2022 adjustments, they've been stable right the way through the year. If anything, they've been coming down through the course of the year in its totality across all the businesses. So we're pleased with the performance of the book and Stage 3 balances are a testimony to that point. There is a broader point around performance of the book as a whole, which as you know, we took about a GBP1.5 billion charge during the year. About GBP500 million of that was a net MES charge, about GBP915 million was underlying. And that underlying also being influenced by things like Stage 1 roles, as I mentioned in my comments earlier on. So the reason I say that is just to reinforce the point that the underlying performance of the book across all of the retail and commercial aspects of it, has been very benign during the course of the year, and we've been very pleased with it so far, albeit we clearly have to remain vigilant in the context of a taking economic environment. ."

The other bit of -- the other bit of noise, if you like, that we get within the SME business, when you look at Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 is bounceback loans. Those are sometimes responsible for slightly different numbers than you might first expect it's still categorized according to the accounting stages, albeit we don't incur the loss.

We built into our budgets, cost increase expectations of around GBP300 million over that time. We think we're going to get closer to GBP900 million to GBP1 billion somewhere.

Firstly, interestingly, through the last 6 months and then as we look forward, there's always been smaller players, actually, the building societies and smaller banks and now some of the fintechs that have been -- they've needed to look at higher rates to attract the funding, that's not the biggest area we see our customers going actually.

The second thing is, typically, what I see is how sharp people get around only retain the minimum in current account versus using alternative savings is partly linked to inflation. And of course, what you've seen in our base rate assumptions is we do get back down to a 2% inflation level, which means that people with meaningful savings aren't seeing a level of deterioration that they felt at the moment or last quarter. And that's really important when you look at consumer behavior, where the vast majority of consumers not by value, but by number are operating in pretty thin transactional accounts relative to their spending. So whether we get exactly back down to 4% or 5%, I don't know because we can't crystal ball gaze, our assertion would be -- I think that would be -- it would take a number of years and it would really depend on how inflation played out and how people thought about the savings and/or investments being affected by inflation. When you get to that stage, by the way, the maturity around and how you can help customers around getting a return that does defend their savings and/or investments and also our strategic investment in our investment capability becomes really important, and I'll smile because you'll get this immediately many of you because you cover my old organization. There's an interesting dynamic where investments returns, which are in the 50 basis points level start to become attractive to encourage people to put money into simple investments relative to deposits. So there's a whole broader spectrum of a way of competing. I think it's a good way of looking at the market, but I think it's a few years out. And based on the economics, I would be surprised if we get to that place."

And I think structurally, there are some differences post the financial crisis, not least the model of originating to distribute the mortgage portfolio is not worrying about the capital costs and then the regulatory implications around how you have to manage funding and the duration mismatch on interest rates is all very, very different today. So I think there's a structurally different kind of set of economics around the mortgage businesses."

I always tell you a averages, but I'm going to give you an average. The fact that the average mortgage customer at Lloyds Banking Group in the industry has an income of GBP75,000. And obviously, LTV is now down at 41%. And you've seen -- you can see in the appendix the LTV, we give you the 2010 data around the LTVs in the mortgage portfolio versus our 1.3% above 90% today. It's a radically, radically different market. So we have a clear view and as well the other providers in the U.K. around what level you can sustainably provide through cycle returns for mortgage customers. And I think the 2005 to 2007 period is materially different and would be hard to repeat going forward. However, the question around how does competition play out and how do we compete is absolutely William's talked about how we're thinking about it in this period."

    "text": "The other dynamic is if you're there, if you're in 2026, if you have a view that rates are now coming down, you then start to have a really important discussion around which balance sheets and which organizations are best placed to deal with a lowering rates environment. And as you know, to really deal with that, you need balance between assets and liabilities. You need a good mix of assets. You need to participate meaningfully in consumer finance. Otherwise, you're not going to be able to put -- you're not going to be able to generate the spreads in a lower income environment. and you have strong risk management and capital management discipline. So you'll have a view around that between the different institutions in the U.K., but that's why we have confidence when we look at 2026 and beyond."

The -- one of the factors that we are looking at closely right now is to what extent inflation has an impact upon the overall balances that we have within the bank, both on the current account and also on the savings side. So to what extent does that come through in terms of payments, salary checks, for example, what is the lasting effect of that upon the balances. So on side of that in a higher interest rate environment, you obviously get the benefit of that building into balances, too. ."

Just separately, Chris, you asked about 5-year I gave you 50-50. I think it's more like 60% 5-year and then about 40% 2 and 3-year. So that the way of characterizing the balance.

If I take your Q4 number, deduct out the one-off deduct a quarter of the IFRS 17 headwind that you flagged and then put that into future years, grinding kind of 2%, 3% higher as you go through the years. Is that the right way to think about other income growth from here? And then secondly, on the pension, you talked about the triennial coming up this year. Your PSA came down in half 2 for the presumably partly because of pension risk. Is there something to play for here when we get the triennial? Is there more pension risk seeing the pillar way? I know you be able to quantify it, but is that something material that could develop there. It's important, I guess, for an institution where you've talked before about potentially reevaluating management's capital target."

And as you know, it's been -- it's taken some time to get there. I mean I've been quite cautious in terms of our overall AI trends within the last couple of years. But I think what we saw in Q4 to a degree, what we saw in 2022 as a whole, is encouraging in the sense that if you strip out the effect of assumptions, if you strip out the things like GI weather, and you look at the underlying within retail, within commercial and in insurance, you see signs of progress."

These are developing a little bit of momentum, and we see year-on-year improvements, both '22 over '21 and also Q4 over Q3, even on a relatively micro basis like that. When we look forward, Ben, you're right to strip out the IFRS 17 effects that we see. If you took those kind of literally, you would go from the performance that we've seen stripping out the IFRS 17, you get down to about . when you look at the underlying performance that we expect for 2022, we expect to outperform the 4.7 . So a little bit of growth that we will follow through on and deliver during the course of 2023 would be our expectation then I don't want to get too excited. It's linked into the achievement of our strategic initiatives, which are big OOI drivers for us in the years going ahead. '23 is just the foothills of that, but we do expect to build into it over the course of the year."

We took a -- we had a benefit from pensions liabilities coming down, which helped our Pillar 2A charge come down 1.5% during the course of the year. Looking forward, there is more to go for there from pensions side. So if we continue to reduce the pension deficit, we should see some benefit from that in Pillar 2A. Having said that, we've pointed out in the past 1 or 2 regulatory uncertainties out there. And the regulatory playing field, if you like, is still being played out as we speak. Things like CID 4, all the issues that you'll be aware of. So overall, that leads us to be comfortable with where we are in terms of our capital guidance of 13.5%, recognizing final point, Ben, that we do intend to distribute down to that over the course of '23 and '24, as we've indicated previously."
