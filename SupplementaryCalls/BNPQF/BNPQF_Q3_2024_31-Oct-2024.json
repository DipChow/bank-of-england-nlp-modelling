But can you run us through the main growth levers? Obviously not the whole thing, we've done it in the presentation, but just the two three areas that you think really will be a swing factor for you from next year given the rates. I noticed in your presentation that I have this red and green arrows. And apart Arval and Belgium, everything looks green and the right direction. But what can you tell us in this stage what you have in mindset for '25, '26 and what's the market missing, you think? Thank you."

So that's basically what it is. There is nothing else to read in it. We have all the services, we are there to serve and we basically are doing so and stepping up market share in particularly in Europe. So Tariq, that will be the answer to your first question.

You can look at the evolution of the topline plan in the third quarter. It will stabilize in the fourth quarter. Next year, if you look at Belgium again will be clearly north of 3%. Our target is clearly above 3%. And looking at Personal Finance that is still in negative territory. Globally, even if you look at the core perimeter, it's up 1.2% if I remember well. Next year the whole Personal Finance will be up. And if you concentrate on the core perimeter, probably north of 5%."

You're expecting post all the actions you've done for the division that I mean, do we think like Q3, which normally seasonally lower is equal to Q1, which actually normally is a good quarter. Is that kind of a run rate or again I really come back on, we should have you look at the full year, look at what you've done in nine months and have an idea on how to analyze that and see what will be the new level for EPS.

So I cannot tell you that it is a fixed number of run rates you should go for. What I'm saying is I'm stepping up the market share of the demand that is happening within that quarter.

If you look at the NII, it doesn't look like a retail banking, regular retail banking activity because of a number of factors, especially the fact that you have flows from the balance sheet out of the balance sheet and vice versa.

I hear the comments you made last around OTD having been delayed a bit by a quarter and securitization coming in Q4. But isn't there anything more to add to that? I mean I was looking at the RWA move Q-on-Q, credit risk as well as operational risk. RWA I think went up.

I think essentially the question I have for you because the messaging you have is clear on why you think it will rebound in '25, '26. The question is really about the timing of the bottom because if I look at Q1, Q2, Q3, Eurozone retail banking revenues have been kind of flattish in $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion.

And the second question expands on, I guess Delphine's question earlier. Looking at the fourth quarter last year, you surprised the market with a fairly poor set of results. And that was coming both from unusually weak revenue and also quite a spike of the cost base which almost looked like a kitchen sink. Is there any reason from what you can see today to believe that we're going to see something similar again in the fourth quarter of this year? Thank you very much."

It looks like we're back to the Q4 levels. Can you just discuss the rate sensitivity and the structure of that business anymore. I would have thought we would have seen a little better performance, but maybe I missed something on rates. And then I think I heard, can you clarify what you said earlier, you were asked about, I think the U.K. motor finance market and I heard $100 million. Could you just clarify what that was in relation to. I mean, I can go back and look at the transcript, but if you could just clarify that here, that would be great."

So those things, that is where we can make a difference. So there are other kind of local kind of products that we don't compete in and that we step up. And that is why you see basically the loans going up, and therefore, you also see the net income margin being impacted by it.

So, I get the performance was very positive on a year over year basis, but it was quite weak versus Q2 even when we look at yourselves versus European peers. And at the same time you said in Q2 that that didn't include any one-offs but that perhaps all the stars were aligned in Q2. So I just wanted to dig into what part of the business weakened Q-on-Q for BNP in Q3. Maybe if you could give some color in terms of that sequential performance in derivatives versus prime versus cash. I know prime was up a lot year over year, but it looks like that business must have probably reduced quite a bit, Q3 versus Q2, but the balance sheet only was down about 3%.

The color I can give and that is probably what you hint at or explore. It is, if you look at the, the real estate, we anticipated that there would be a pickup in 2025.
