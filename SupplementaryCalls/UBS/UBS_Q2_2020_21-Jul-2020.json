I guess as we look into the second quarter, first of all, of course, what we observed during the - as we look into the third quarter, excuse me, we reserved during the second quarter is volatility did come down during the quarter.

We'll get back and confirm that. But outside of that there's nothing else right now on the horizon to increase our overall RWAs. Of course, with the exception of finalization of Basel III, which at the moment, of course, has been pushed forward until 2022 and we believe we'll get more updates on that timing from our regulator in the third quarter."

But I think that it is clear that regulators around the world have made it clear that banks should be prudent and flexible in respect to their capital return policies. And so, considering the uncertainties that we have still head of us, we've fully shared those views, and therefore we are already reflecting this in our thinking around capital returns, mix definitely rebalancing the two, more towards cash and more balanced approach between cash dividends and buybacks. And this is already reflecting - is reflected in the way we are accruing for this year."

So, how should we think about that balancing act between the kind of lower deposit spreads, but also the treasury income and of course the high loan growth you are delivering, and also could you give us detail of where your lending demand is coming from, both geographically and from a product perspective.

I highlighted the fact that we are carrying excess balances as [indiscernible] balances in response to COVID stress, we're going continue to carry excess liquidity balances, and a portion of that cost would be pushed out to the business divisions including to GWM and that will have somewhat offsetting effects of what otherwise was positive trajectory into the third quarter."

I think it's fair to say that's what you see now where FRC business is the outcome of more of a strategic decision. It is correct that we took off lot of balance sheet and capital consumption in those areas. But as you know, FX is pretty much capital light.

So, in respect of your question on CET1 ratio, fair points, I think that we always say that the 13% anchoring, the 13% plus minus was something that should be seen in the transition into the full implementation of Basel III."

But we haven't really shared concrete plans with regulators because it's premature, but of course, we – our commitment was not to do any share buyback until the third quarter at least and then we will revisit the situation where we are in a position to discuss these matters."

And that included a combination of clients actually preferring to move into advisory versus managed mandates that carry a lower margin, along with segment mixes as we continue to build up our GFO and our ultra high net worth versus our high net worth business naturally they do come in with larger volumes, but lower margin overall our mandates."

And then on top of that, you have not only the statistical modeling that we run, which is the pure output, and you see that it was 127 on 2019. But then you have all the SME expertise and the overlays and the other considerations like our modeling is not going to be able to reference the impact of stimulus."

In terms of the RWA side, you should take that $5 billion is just an order of magnitude an approximation where we do, do kind of an across the portfolio estimation of what one notch downgrade would do in terms of our RWA sensitivity."

So first of all Sergio on the last conference call on Q1 conference call, you pointed out that you were hopeful that some of the regulatory loosening which was put in place when COVID really struck would become of a permanent nature rather than of a temporary nature? And I was just wondering whether you had any additional thoughts on the topic, i.e. is do you feel that the regulatory discussion is moving in this direction that some of these changes become permanent?"

So when you talk about how this public health crisis is changing the way you work and accelerating the pace of change. Just a question for a concrete example on real estate that you called out in particular, I mean, is it as simple to say that you expect that in the future, a larger portion of your population will be working from home and therefore you'll require less office space or is it more complicated than that? And when you think about the quantum of that impact, how important is this? Are we talking about a percent of the cost base, higher or even lower?"

So we have zero concessions that order than the leverage one which we are not using or reporting to because as Kirt mentioned before, we are more bind by risk-weighted assets at this stage. And so, I don't see any trend, which I believe most likely regulators will take the lessons learned out of the COVID and make an analysis of if and when they want to reconsider some of those changes going forward."

I see it also as a positive signs of willingness to engage. But I haven't seen anything concrete emerging, and it's probably not the right thing to do postmortem analysis. I think that we should wait till probably the end of the year or the early part of next year to do that."

So the concept of business continuity management has been dramatically changed by COVID. So and of course, we are already starting to put a lot of thoughts about how to manage that, but also then, as I mentioned before, how to think about two elements of flexibility of the workspace. One is, offices where we have our people are serving clients or helping in the infrastructure."

So, we do the same for wealth management, the IB, P&C and asset management and there is no reason to treat the IB in a different way. So the CET1 ratio, actually if you look at their consumption is very close to – it’s a mix between CET1 component and leveraged components, which is a good mix to reflect their true capital consumption on a CET1 basis."

Sabine Keller-Busse, our COO thinks that we can even go toward her, you know at this stage it is not important if it is 20% or 30%. That directionally speaking, we are moving there. But we're not going have 80% like today, because at the end of the day, we can go on for another few quarters in managing the bank in this way, but over time, as I mentioned before, in our business, particularly in the wealth management and in everything which has to do with advisory, but also in the culture of a firm, you can't have everybody working from home. You're going to have to have social interactions and staying so to clients. So, we're going to move maybe from an 80/20 to a 20/80 or 30/70, I don't know. It's not so important. But if you think about the ramification of only 20% or 30% of the people working from home is huge."
