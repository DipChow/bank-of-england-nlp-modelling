Could you talk a bit more about the expected timing of that project? I think you said you got the Wealthfront acquisition closing in the second half of this year. How much time do you think you need for integration work before or after that, or for developing a new combined offering if that's the plan? So basically, what will be live when, if you can just talk through the timeline? And then, my second question on a different topic is about the share buybacks. I'm just trying to get a sense of how likely you are to do the full $5 billion in 2022. So could you talk a bit about how you will calibrate the pace of buybacks in each period through the year? What metrics that will be based on? Will you have blackout periods like last year? Would you have big variations between quarters like last year. That will be great. Thank you."

On Wealthfront, clearly first we need to get all the different approvals that one needs working with teams, making sure it's a smooth transition to actually close the transaction, so that's stage number one. And asset, we expect this to happen more towards while in the second half of this year."

They're having a unique proposition and you don't want to interfere too much. On the contrary, you have to look at, okay, what are some of the easy wins here? So for example, the easy wins are that they have -- they're not only a wealth manager, they also provide banking services, they have a cash sweep arrangement. We can look at the cash sweep arrangement for our own business. So that will be an opportunity right there."

For that we don't really have to do a full integration -- we just have to make sure that there is a good connection between our workplace wealth services, ++and then for Wealthfront to be introduced. So those are the ones that you can do easily for which you don't even need integration. Now, the second opportunity, Dan, is the one for these engineers who are very good engineers and they really wanted to join UBS because we are a wealth manager, and that's what they were looking for, because they believe in Wealth Management to see whether they can actually help UBS also developing further propositions."

So unlike last quarters, when we advise on a quarter-by-quarter basis, in this case, we're actually giving you advice on what we intend to do for the remainder of year without pause. Now, obviously, still, the overall volume we can repurchase will depend on the actual volume of shares traded and the liquidity on SIX, and our calculation of up to $5 billion is based on what we've seen in terms of volumes in the past, and so we think that that's within reach. But clearly, it's going to be dependent on how much liquidity and how much volume is actually traded in our shares on SIX."

Should I understand that this will be dependent on your M&A plans meaning provided you do not do additional acquisitions this year, then you would intend to distribute as much as $5 billion via buybacks and therefore maybe can you tell us more regarding your M&A plans and how you are planning to make the decision between M&A or buybacks.

We have a business that generates a lot of capital, but in the organic growth, doesn't use a lot of capital. Clearly we are -- we do lending, we have investment banking activities, they all use capital, but the growth of the use of capital is not foreseeing to needing all of the capital that we generate. On the contrary, so it will always be quite a lot of capital left over to support first growth has to set -- well first, make sure we have a good balance sheet. Second, to support the growth.

I can't just say, well, why don't you wait for next year because we have -- we are -- it made destroy our capital return plan? That's not what we do. But we have ample capital to return.

That's a little bit the type of bolt-on. We're not necessarily looking, if it comes it comes.

And you saw in 2021, we actually generated $7.7 billion of capital. And so as we look at this year and also we've included in Slide 53, the RWA trajectory, we feel we have ample capital to be able to invest. Firstly, our first priority, of course, is business growth, achieving any regulatory requirements, and then to accrue our cash dividend, we indicated we'll be progressive in our cash dividend. Our cash dividend accrual was $1.7 billion for the $0.50 in 2021 but it does give us good confidence and comfort that we can actually repurchase the -- up to $5 billion and still have ample flexibility to address other priorities as and when they come up."

It has got $27 billion of assets under management. It is a segment that you refer to as one that is lower than our normal Wealth segment that we cover. That is true and it's not true. It is certainly true if it comes to the segment that we cover through personalized advice with advisors.

I think if we take out the French provisions, you have generated about 19% return in 2021, targeting 15% to 18%. The denominator will probably not grow a lot. So it seems that you're implying with these targets declining profits. And I was wondering what conceptually would cost profits to decline and also how this jibes with the explicit target of 10% to 15% profit growth in Wealth Management, your biggest business. And a second aspect of the financial targets, in the past you have explicitly limited the capital consumption of the investment bank up to a 1/3 of the group and I think that that target is gone. Is there anything that we should read into that or is it just a cleanup effort of a target that was not really needed anymore?"

So nothing has changed there. It's just that we don't repeat it as a target per se. But nothing has changed to the way we deal with the capital allocation to the Investment Bank. So it's kind of a target that was always there. We will always have made, and therefore it doesn't serve a purpose anymore. But be assured, we will continue with the same discipline there.

In addition to that, we've got another $11 billion related to regulatory requirements and right now we're anticipating around $20 billion in order to address a Basel III finalization subject to FINMA and some final decisions. I think the other factor, if you look at our performance in 2021, of course, we actually had a net provision release."

It looks like you don't need to maintain much capital at all through 2025. You've obviously got U.S. DTA benefits that grosses up your capital generation. So could theoretically payout ratios be pretty high going forward. And how should we think about that in terms of buybacks beyond 2022, given you kind of mentioned some limitations on AGV on the and whether you need to kind of further up with the dividend to manage that capital in excess capital going forward. And then secondly on cost-income, the targets just look very conservative to me. If you adjust for the litigation, NII upside which should drop straight to the bottom line, I'm getting low 70s already. If you put a billion of cost savings which you are reinvesting in growth, marginal cost of growth should be low. I mean, what -- why 70 to 73? Why can't we go lower than that?"

I think if you look at what we indicated this year, $5 billion and then you take the $1.7 billion progressively on cash dividend that gets you to around 7 billion. On top of that, of course, we'll deploy $1.4 billion in the acquisition that we're making the Wealthfront acquisition in the second half of the year. You just compare that to our net profit in 2021, and you can easily get to a payout ratio that's greater than 100%, which is logical because we're starting at 15% overall CET1 ratio."

It shows that indeed we can continue to generate substantial capital and also have very, very high payout ratios and still manage to our overall capital ratio while addressing Basel III and the capital that's required to grow the business. Now turning to your cost-income question, again, I'll provide really a similar answer to the one I provided before. It's just as we look at the business, as we think about the investments that we're looking to make, well, we intend to continue to be -- have positive operating leverage overall as we go through the next couple of years."

So Smart Wealth for the ones who don't know it, was a Wealth Management proposition -- digital Wealth Management proposition that we once had. We closed it down.

It was not a protected [Indiscernible] that was allocated, it didn't really have a marketing angle to it. It was not focused on user experience and it was -- and we focused too much on P&L from the beginning. And honestly, if you want to build a business, you have to separate it, you have to protect it for a while, you have to have it grow. And if you expect P&L to come from a business like that in the first five years, basically, you're setting it up for failure because it's not going it's not going to happen. Because even if it is digital, you need scale. And scale, you can only have with clients. And the clients only come if you do marketing and you have a cost of acquisition."

Because even in a digital world, you need to make sure that you can create the scale. And in banking, whether we like it or not, there is a couple of things that will always determine scale from a more domestic perspective. So if you go into a market, you will have local regulations, local tax laws as you buy by, investment products are geared towards that as well.

So also, digital offerings need local scale and therefore needs to be in large economies, large wealth pools.

Now, that was versus a guidance of being up a couple of $100 million, so we actually outperformed our guidance. And as we look at 2022, again, we're guiding on that same TDC. However, we're excluding restructuring because we're acknowledging, listen, we're going to have restructuring each year so we're not going to look at that as part of what we want to exclude when we think about our cost base because that no longer, for us, makes any sense."

First, they're really driven by the same culture the same value. And they have true engineering culture. Their technology is proprietary. It is open. We can connect it. We can reuse it in parts. It will accelerate our own engineering culture as well, it's good to have that. The second thing is Wealthfront is not a robo advisor. I know people talk about it"

And we run quite some programs to ensure that we would always be in compliance with some of those -- with all of those.

So basically, with that, we have crowded out some less strategic projects that we're maybe seeing but the division itself, as strategic, but on a higher level would be seen as marginally strategic as one, or for which we could actually accelerate some of the other projects that are just more remunerative or more important to us in other divisions."

And for us, clearly, the pool of customers we already have to offer Wealthfront services to, we don't have to acquire anymore. And we just have to generate the leads towards Wealthfront, and make sure that our customers are happy with what Wealthfront does for them. So that would be a pretty low cost of acquisition for a Wealthfront perspective, let me put it that way."

You have to do it the way -- that's the way we approach it, and Wealthfront approaches as well. And then you have to look at your customer lifetime value. And you see that the customers of Wealthfront have a very long lifetime and, therefore, their lifetime value is actually very high. And then you can afford also to do more on the customer acquisition costs if you get the same profile. So there are pretty long-tenured clients there. They're very -- they have a very loyal client base, and every new client seems to have the same profile there."

    "text": "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two from me, please. One on cost, and one on the M&A strategy. Some costs if I look at slide 30, you've been very explicit on your 2022 guidance of costs, excluding compensation or should take variable compensation and litigation. If I do the compensation competitiveness, clear the key topic coming out of U.S. bank reporting, for example. If I look at your variable and FA compensation cost, they're up $700 million. If you adjust for the 2021 off relating to the deferred award acceleration, I think they're up just over $1 billion, and that compares to $3.2 billion in revenue growth, so you're looking at a marginal cost income 35% there. Do you think that's a good proxy going forward to model those compensation costs? So that would be my first question. Second question is from the M&A strategy. Wealthfront's an interesting acquisition in part because you've talked about organic being your default strategy."

If I try and think of a --not exactly the same but similar prospect that you have outside of the U.S. it would be My Way. You talked about now having $7 billion of assets.

And then you have -- and we have one of those as well, which is UBS Advantage, as you were referring to, which plays in a higher wealth segment actually. It's a 9th digital wealth manager in the U.S., but it plays in a higher segment. But again, it's digital-only. My Way is a way to digitalize the mandate business. So it is one which you get a completely different client experience where the client feels that he or she is much closer to allocating portfolios, to sectors, regions, different asset category. And then leave it to UBS to manage within the boundaries that you set through My Way. and it helps the engagement of our customers."

So better customer experience, seamless execution, and productivity increase. So that -- My Way I would see much more -- much more as a digital improvement in what we call the personal adviser segment, and UBS Advantage, and Wealthfront are much more in the digital -- digitally-customized segments."

If you're a UBS client, you can actually get into UBS, and UBS will then transact. If you're not, you would have to become a new client. So it's both creating of an open ecosystem for non-clients. But clearly, it is also an ecosystem that generates new clients for us as well, sort of as different experiments.

However, we're very consistent in terms of how we accrue compensation, variable compensation for FAs, really that can almost be looked at as the FA's total compensation because of course it's there are higher payout, but salaries are quite de minimize. That overall payout depends on the grids; the grids are pretty public. It also depends on mix, which is aligned with the grid. So the more lending we do, more NII, the actual overall less payout, and therefore the percentage of payout to revenue, the marginal payout is lower."

It consistently is based on what we call S-curves. And we also accrue after. So we accrue against economic profit. So we always look at the equity allocation to the various different types of revenue and also the costs to generate that revenue before we take into your accrual for variable compensation. And that approach is not going to change going forward."

First is on what steps are you taking our initiatives to change the mindset and like if incentivized staff, because we took a look at agile structure, cooperation. And I mean, you mentioned you have quarterly reviews of the investment budget. But what are there sort of like levers for you to support a more agile and operation and as well as larger cooperation. The second is on your ESG and sustainability initiatives. Clearly, a lot of banks are talking about it, but is it a net positive for you? You gave us a number of $400 billion of invested assets and compare this to the $250 billion. Probably not all of this is a net positive but using net you are one of the winners and then that positive sense given your business mix."

On ESG, you're talking about the sustainability and impact investment category where we have grown to $251 billion this year out of which $172 billion is within the Asset Management. And we actually see inflows coming across, literally across, new clients coming in specifically for this offering. Existing clients moving part of their mandates, part of their business into that offering. So I would certainly say given our reputation and given the effort we put in, in being the leader, being the thought leader on the ESG side as well, and that's why we centralized all of our ESG activities outside of the business divisions because I want to get us consistent across everything we do, and that will further increase our reputation and attract new money."

For the moment, but with all the plans we have, for sure we will continue to be at the forefront there as a thought leader, not only for us as a company, but also in terms of the products that we deliver and making sure that we continue to cater for more specific needs. This can be as general as, okay, I want to have a portfolio with high ESG -rated companies. It could also be, I would want to invest in water purification technology only, or in whatever new technology there is that can help the climate, for example. So we certainly see ourselves there as a relative winner. It is one of our strengths in the Asset Management business. It is certainly also one of our strengths now if it comes to, if it comes to our CIO strategies, basically we have since September 2020 already, indicated that sustainable investments are the preferred category."

They see it in our advice. They see it in our products. And therefore I do expect us to be a relative winner also going forward. The second question, which was your first question, is in agile. And how do you get everybody to go agile. It's a combination of many things. So there is a couple of characteristics in agile that you need to get right and the first one is, that you need to make sure that people see collaboration as an important element. And, that teamwork is an important element rather than individual contribution is an important element."

Already in the beginning of last year, we changed our culture components that we actually can detect in the behavior of people. For example, the first one is I take accountability with integrity and the second one is around collaboration. And the third one is around innovation. And those are behavioral components that we basically launched as part of the three keys program that has been very successful for the last ten years.

One is one of the three components, and individual accountability, which basically means I take action. When I see something needs to be done is also a very important component of the behaviors. And they are part of your appraisal, and with that part of your remuneration. That's one element and that goes through the whole organization whether we already working Agile or not. The second one is that at the top level, as I was just alluding to, we basically do everything now as a team. And therefore the financial KPIs for all of our executive team are the same. So nobody has financial KPIs for their specific division or area. We as an executive team, have one standard KPI set. If it comes to financial performance. And it's also showing to the organization that we want to manage this as a team."

Now, those are two high-level things that really help when you start to introduce Agile deeper into the organization, where basically you create the self-steering teams, we call them parts, multi-functional teams that have to collaborate together that basically are empowered to deliver every two weeks as to what they need to deliver. That they already have -- that they're already surrounded by some of these key behavioral components that we subscribe to -- that we have launched, as well as incentives components linked to that is right here already.

We used to have the pre -tax margin target to 25%, and I guess if we think more recently we've seen some of your tiers in that market, pushing the bar a bit higher, and I'm looking for margins above 30%. Given the configuration of the business currently worth and you're still sub 20% on pre -tax margin. Is that a realistic range to think about over the medium-term? The second question is, on the interest income sensitivity guidance. you've given on Slide 32 for the current forward curve, the $800 million of NII upside. I don't know if you can give any figures beyond full year '22, does that figure grow? Is it an accumulation of gains on the current forward curve once you start thinking about reinvestment further on beyond full year’22? Thanks very much."

And so the trajectory is moving in the right direction, and we expect that that's going to continue. And it's also helped by, of course, our lending, given the fact that the payout ratios are in lending and that's something I just addressed. And that's very, very accretive to our margins."

We've gone from $1 billion, we're now over -- we hit just over $2 billion this year, and we've done that over the last five years, and we're on a run rate above $1 billion overall.
