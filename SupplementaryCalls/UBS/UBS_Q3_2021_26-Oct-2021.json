Can you maybe quantify how much of that would be specifically US driven? And also what would be the time frame for that $1.6 billion, whether it's over 12 months or longer.

So this is not agile on the technology side and then you have a completely different rhythm in the rest of the organization. Now this is front to back agile, which basically means that people who know the customer interface, the people who know the products, the processes. The people who are actually into engineering, you basically put them into multidisciplinary teams and you run them in two weeks sprint towards an outcome. And if the outcome is satisfactory you go for another sprint. And if not you either kind of fix it or I'd assume the moment you may even stop the project, right? So that's one."

The only thing what we can do is -- and what you will -- what you've heard today and what you will hear more of in three months' time is that we know what the power of UBS is and we know how to orchestrate the ecosystem of capabilities that we have in-house or that we can orchestrate with third-party providers in order to service our clients best. That's what we do. That's what we work on a daily basis. And we feel that that potential of UBS working across the more divisional structures if you will but be much more client-focused that that is what can bring out the best of UBS and the potential of UBS. And you will see many of our plans geared towards that. And that is how I am confident that our valuation will further improve. Any comparison to any peer who has a completely different constellation of income and strongholds and home markets is a difficult one to make. We do what we think is best to bring the best of UBS to our clients. And with that we do think there is quite some potential here. So that's my point here."

When you last gave an Investor Day, I was always intrigued that with Asia, with LATAM, with Europe and Switzerland there were PBT growth target for those regions, whereas, the US it was more about improving the PBT margin. So I think the aim is getting the margin up to 25%. Is that still the case for the US business? Is it much more about enhancing the margin rather than an absolute profit growth target?"

And in fact a lot of those volumes came out of our US institutional clients that we're looking to trade around some of the volatility during the quarter. Conversely the uncertainty regarding and in reaction to some of the policy changes were much -- is much more concentrated in our wealth management client base and that did show up in some deleveraging part of which we initiated as well as a consequence of that deleveraging some outflows."

If you look at our quarterly profit for the third quarter, we're up over 43% and we're well above $500 million. So we're now on a run rate of over $1 billion. And so we're seeing growth in scale, in our Wealth Management business and we're also seeing growth in scale in our Asset Management business and partly the contribution in the ecosystem in fact, for example, with the SMA initiative that we launched later last year along with some of the collaboration revenue we're seeing in the IB all gives us good confidence that we're going to continue to see good growth momentum there.

Are these into advisory discretionary mandates or is it third-party funds? And how that looks in terms of the margin on the business coming in?

You can do the math, and you know that, there is ample opportunity for us to continue to engage very actively in buybacks. I'll also â€“ I would mention that, if you look at the one constraint we do have, it's â€“ we generally will repurchase up to about 25% of our shares any given day in the market, just so that we're not overly influencing price moves.

I mean, I think if you look at our Asian business, naturally we are exposed to structured products. That's in particular is a big part of our equity derivatives platform both on the side of our investment bank, where we're very focused on structured derivatives, and that's not just in Asia Pacific, it's across all markets. We've actually rebalanced our equity derivatives business."

And then we're also exposed on the distribution side for our Wealth Management clients as they tend to like to invest, particularly when they see volatility in the marketplace. They like to invest in structure products and we generally â€“ and we did, and we referenced one of the reasons you saw year-on-year growth in our transaction revenue in Wealth Management is, because we did see higher structured product revenue. But again, not just Asia Pacific, but really across all regions."

The deleveraging is just about making sure that the Lombard loans as well and the LTVs and the Lombard loans that they get honored. And depending on the concentration under these loans, and the movement of some of the underlying stock the question is okay, how do you kind of recalibrate your portfolio to be more diversified, more internationally diversified, et cetera, et cetera. And that's a discussion that went on and that's how we also support our clients through a change in sentiment and by recalibrating their portfolio."

So I guess what I would like to know is what's the track record of UBS say the past five years for assets that have been transferred down from say one generation to the next? So is it sort of 80%, 90%? Any sort of indication around that would be good. And for those that don't convert down the generations why is that? What's typically driving that? And then secondly could you provide more color around the associate loss in Asset Management please? Is that something we should expect again or is that just a onetime thing? Thanks."

And the first one I don't have those numbers Tom, but in general how it works, is that clearly if you -- the transfer of wealth from one generation to the other may come with a choice for either a different adviser or a different channel altogether. As you can imagine it's a new generation. And that is what -- why it is so important that we have different channels in the market different offerings in the market as well."

But there's -- but it certainly is looking at okay, if you have generational transfers do you need to have different coverage different financial advisers or different channel altogether in order to manage that. And in general, what we do is we're very early on in these discussions. As you can imagine the transfer of wealth from one generation to the other specifically if it also has to do with the underlying business itself."

We take our clients through some of this make sure they feel comfortable before they even take the decision. And once they take the decision we also make sure that every step of the way they understand what's happening. And so it's -- this is what we do. This is our business."

We bring the children together of wealthy clients so that they can interact as well.
