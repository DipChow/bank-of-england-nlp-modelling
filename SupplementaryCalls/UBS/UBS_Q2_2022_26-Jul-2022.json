One regarding the NII trajectory and sensitivity and another one on the net new fee generation inflows into the kind of into wealth and what you're thinking about it going forward? So on the NII, your sensitivity kind of changed slightly versus the last time you've published this. We had a kind of slightly less U.S. dollar sensitivity. But of course, the biggest change is actually coming from Swiss franc and of course, kind of unsurprisingly so given the rate hike and, of course, kind of very different rate trajectory in Switzerland from here. But could you kind of run us through how this is going to pan out on a more of a quarterly basis? Because, of course, your initial sensitivity to Swiss franc interest rate is slightly negative given the Central Bank liquidity and also your deposit charging practice. How -- and of course, then it's kind of -- it goes up as the rates move above 0. Could you give us a sense how you think that's going to pan out and also on U.S. dollar? Is it really a kind of question of effectively having spent some of that. Your NII has already increased by the 24% in GWM in particular. So that's on NII."

Who knows the future, certainly these are uncertain times. Having said that, we are very focused on supporting our customers through this mandate and therefore, net new fee-generating assets is a very good alternative with our CIO strategies there. They are attractive. We are continuing to hire, for example, also financial advisers in the U.S. that should also give further rise of increases in net new fee generating assets. And the first week of the first weeks of the third quarter, basically look broadly positive across the whole franchise."

So on NII, I think what you're noticing and it's not surprising is that in the U.S. because we have already seen some of the changes, the sensitivity decreases and that is, I would say, mathematically always to happen. And then, of course, we had the events in Switzerland, which were not expected as of last quarter and that's come in. So in terms of like how that translates for us, the first thing that I would say is that the guidance that we gave last quarter stands on a static balance sheet basis as we gave it last quarter. And if you want to dig a little bit into what has happened. You heard the excellent numbers that I mentioned, the 24% year-on-year up in GWM, sequentially 11%. The increase in margin by 60%. The performance was strong. And our actual betas were lower than our modeled betas. So that was on the U.S."

And the good news, though is that at least the expectation today is that we would stay probably a very little time in that zone and we'll be able to benefit from the tailwind once we are into the positive territories."

Clearly, the pricing that -- the way we have done our pricing there, it was not at a full minus 75 basis points anyway, right? So because we very much look at the client side there. So from that perspective, if the SMB does not further hike yes, it may be a bit of a downtick, but I wouldn't talk about headwinds there, honestly. So..."

If you look at investor sentiment, we do see a decrease of that sentiment with Asia being more optimistic and across the different regions. So that's a little bit the sentiment around it.

So clearly, I don't want to make just about the second quarter in terms of future market share movements, but just trying to understand from your perspective, because I'm sure on the Executive Board, you discussed it, why you think you underperformed in equities, fixed income, IBD, U.S. Wealth, and I would even say Europe wealth against (inaudible) yesterday."

So the deleveraging in Asia Pacific last we saw continued deleveraging of minus â‚¬3.3 billion in Asia Pacific in net new loans. Who knows, honestly. It really depends on how things develop. But I do expect that towards the end of the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter, that there will be much more optimistic news coming from China and within Asian. So I do expect that on the back of a confirmation of the political leadership in China. And with that, the confirmation of the economic policies in China and with that also further lifting of restrictions around COVID that the whole Asia area the whole Asia area will basically get a bit of an uplift and will pick things up. And with that, I do expect also then the deleveraging to stop at the moment in time."

That's the way you can read it. And then basically, all of the divisions have a sole lead structure, IB with Rob Karofsky; Asset Management with Sony; and Wealth Management with (inaudible); and then Sabine on the P&C side, but that's local, and then complemented with strong regional leadership. That's the way we go about it because we have an ambitious plan for the U.S. We believe in those plants and the execution of those plans certainly also from a digital perspective, not only for the digital proposition, but also to support the financial advisers as crucial and Naren brings that experience.

So in the first quarter, we had tremendous outperformance in a market that was very much towards the solutions and towards equities and here, we saw the reverse.

So we did not participate in that fee pool. We participated to a degree, but less so on a mix adjusted basis. We did see FX and rates are being strong for us. and financing was a good story in the U.S. and across the world as well as clearing. And then if you do a deal all the adjustments and we do that based on the public information that our peers as they reported in markets, we actually end up if you adjust for mix, if you adjust for the products as well as the regions and then you end up within the range of the performance.

If we truly feel that some of the growth may not come and clearly, we will -- we could work on that side. And we have a savings plan in place, as you know, which is the $1 billion plan that we announced when we announced the strategy. and we are fully on track to deliver the $400 million out of that savings plan this year.

So that's where you see upward pressure on salaries still. And depending on how things unfold, if the inflation becomes stubborn, so to say, and that, in the end, will come through also in general salaries as well also in the areas where there will be less of a label market tension. So that's where you see most of the upward pressure coming through. There's not a lot we can do about that other than further digitalizing our processes so that we can basically manage the account. What we are really working hard on and indicated in my presentation as well is the engineer account as a percentage of the total of technology spend. With that, we create a lot of productivity, which currently we use to continue to invest, but we could also translate that into a different way.

And can you actually say whether clients have moved out of deposits into, let's say, money market funds or other disintermediate forms of savings.

It's definitely something that is important in our plans to grow. So having accomplished a similar percentage given we didn't have that, I think, is a good performance.

And if you build a bank, you build a loan book and you build also a deposit book not just for funding, but also in building deposits as a business. And therefore, the way we go about our deposit pricing, is always one where you look at the commercial opportunity, but also in terms of maximizing the margin and the profitability around it. So it is not pure a funding vehicle for us as it may have been in the past and therefore, and hence, also the qualification of the HQLA book against it. It is more and more a strategic book for us. Hence, the way we price deposits going forward with impact on NII, really looking at the optimal pricing for that, but also the reclassification of the bonds that we hold against it. So it's all related."

Wouldn't anything else rates and FX. So I'm just a bit surprised by the performance in your own FICC business there. And I just wanted to know from what you could see if there was some kind of like macro -- sorry, geographical explanation for that weakness maybe in Europe and APAC versus the U.S. that could explain that."

I mean we've talked a bit more about the size of the balance sheet here, having a bearing this past quarter and especially on the deposit side. Is that the main limiting factor for increasing your bond investments there? Or are there is there greater flexibility to upsize and increase your net interest income?"

    "text": "So Andrew, on the first one, again, I think the way we look at our markets results versus peers and that's why we outperformed them in the first quarter and we may -- we lack a bit in the second quarter. And there is basically 2 components to it. The first one is geographical bias where the U.S. peers are much more biased towards the U.S., and we have a global footprint. That is one. And the second one is the exposure to the rates business versus us the exposure to more equities in structured products business. That generally -- I mean, those are the 2 main factors that, if you correct for that, we feel that we are more or less in line with how peers have produced, but headline shows a different factor. Having said that, the 10% revenue increase for global markets year-on-year, we feel is a good number. But indeed, we have a different setup in our markets business, as you know, we are aligning our investment bank towards what we want to build over time. And therefore, the markets business specifically in equities is very strategic for us. And we don't build an investment bank for being an investment bank. We are building an ecosystem for investing in which wealth management, asset management and investment banking capabilities are very important in order to grow that, but we don't build an investment bank for being an investment bank."

    "text": "Yes, sure. In a rising rate environment, I guess it makes sense to see whether you can upsize bonded investments and increase in net interest income, especially given your move to classify some of these bond investments, these costs. This quarter, we've seen maybe the balance sheet shrinkage and lots of deposits as a limiting factor there. But I mean how do you see that going forward actually, your opportunity to increase bond investments. Is that purely limited by deposits? Or do you have more flex increases?"

    "text": "The way you can think about it is we have the deposits that we have coming from our customers. We have on the offset some of the loans that we have coming from our customers. And then net of the 2 would be a securities portfolio, and we do everything with a view to managing the assets and liabilities through replication and making sure that we get to the appropriate duration to manage the risks. And so there is no particular limit in terms of like how big the investment portfolio can be I would say, theoretically, but for us, what's important is that we wouldn't take an unexposed duration risk. And so what we want to have is a match funding that reflects the quality of the deposits that we have and the duration of the loan book that we have."

I think to sum it all up, as you can see from our numbers, this was for our clients, a challenging quarter where our private clients were sidelining their investments waiting for guidance and also for advice, whereas our institutional clients have really been very active, and that's what you see through the numbers. We have progressed in our strategy if it comes to putting the company closer together, launching digital initiatives working on technology in order to further improve efficiencies as well, keeping costs under control. And that leading to, in our view, a very strong or a good underlying performance, let me put it that way, in the Swiss business, in the markets business and in the wealth business."
