So in terms of payout policies, I don't think that we - you know, the intention here is to continue to distribute and add any excess capital that we don't need to grow the business. And also, I think that the key leavers for us are also very highly determined by not only the guidance we have been giving you on in terms of where we think we're going to be in terms of CET1 ratio until the full Basel III is implemented, because of course, in two or three years time, my colleagues will also have to reassess and rebalance this around 13% to whatever is appropriate."

We have a ongoing plan, and I'm sure Ralph will have that - bring his views and user experience in helping us to make our front to back even more efficient, using data digitalization to the next level. So we have plans, but they need to be executed, and they need to be focused. So I'm sure we will find ways to optimize the way we run the bank front to back."

Clearly, if there is, between now and the end of the quarter, a very significant deterioration in overall macro economic outlook and expectations that we might see spikes in unemployment, for example, as a consequence of more severe lockdowns, we would have to reflect that in any updates that we would make to our models.

And looking forward now that UBS in a position to make these choices, which it wasn't coming out of previous downturns, is there more growth in Wealth Management, because the world's more uncertain?
