So if we go with our revenue impact earlier for the rest of the year, I think at the beginning of the year, we gave some quite fulsome guidance. So we've obviously confirmed the £200 million in relation to the HCCR. I'm sure we'll talk more about our kind of NIM outlook as we're moving forward. But certainly, as we look at where kind of consensus is sitting at the end of the year at the moment, we are very comfortable with that in the round, I would say, in terms of that. If on -- in terms of the kind of revenue opportunities just to kind of look at that piece of the question. If I stick with Personal first, what we'll see as the economy begins to recover, we will see an element of increased retail sales, which will drive our customer fee income, our NII, which relates to our unsecured balances. Credit cards, that's obviously fallen off quite a bit in Q2, and we'll also see new demand for lending. Our H1 mortgage lending was £16 billion, but it was very much split £10 million and £6 million. And so it's good to see that activity to -- that activity seems to be increasing again, which we're very pleased about as well."

So we've got 90 basis points for the first half. We've given you guidance today around RWAs, as to how they might look for the end of the year, £185 million to £195 million. We've also given you £3.5 billion of -- £3.5 billion to £4.5 billion of impairment guidance. If I was to look at those in the round, and if you were to say, let's assume you hit the middle of the RWAs and you hit the middle of the impairment range, you'd -- about 20 basis points would come off on IFRS 9 and then you'd obviously lose on capital about the next drop 70 basis points in terms of that RWA kind of uplift. And then you want to decide what your thoughts are around that. But I would say heading to that middle of that range probably gives you a fair enough kind of guidance.

I would expect and hope as we move into the year, probably more into Q4, I would say that you'll see the new mortgage kind of grow a bit more significantly as the activity of today kind of feeds through into the system, which, of course, is great for income, pools down your margin a little bit, would be great for income.

I think in the second quarter for you in the credit book, so there's actually about a £1 billion procyclical benefit to the risk-weighted assets. And I guess just slightly -- at odds with what's happening on the provision side of things, the IFRS 9 forward-looking provisions are clearly building very substantially. But the RWA movements, which I thought were also supposed to be forward-looking, particularly in the point in time books are going the other way. I mean if I look at your excellent disclosure on IFRS 9, I think the IFRS 9 PDs, obviously, say, the other retail book were up about 65% in the first half, but the Basel PD only moved by 10%. So I guess the question really is, these models actually need to see genuine defaults going up before the procyclicality and the risk-weighted assets comes through. And does that mean that we're likely to see a further build in RWAs for procyclical purposes into next year as well?"

I mean changes in RWAs in H2 will be driven -- obviously, we've got RWA reduction in NatWest Markets, but you have accounted for that already. The level of procyclical is driven by the economy. What we need to do see is the downgrades in the credit quality and the ratings in the commercial book, and also the move through into kind of default coming through as well on the mortgage book. So I do think that there is a risk, and we haven't seemed to quantify it yet into next year because it really is very dependent upon how the next half happens in the speed at which we see the deterioration that you could continue to see some RWA inflation into 2021. You're absolutely right."

Again, in the other retail book, the IFRS 9 default assumption is 4.9%, and it's 4.1% in the Basel model, even though that's supposed to be 12-month forward looking on the same basis as IFRS 9.

If I then plug in the revised disposal losses, you get that. It points to just over £5.1 billion of underlying income for H2.

I think we're I -- if I was to look at the kind of '21 consensus, I would say there's quite a lot of moving parts that have to happen. We've got to see actually how much of these impairments flow through because obviously, you're familiar that when they move to default, we stopped recognizing interest on the [indiscernible] to the income statement. So that will have a little bit of an impact on it. So at the moment, I would say, look, we're kind of broadly comfortable as it stands. I think there's lots of pressure. There's lots of headwinds. There's uncertainty. But it doesn't feel like that it's in a ridiculous kind of place at this stage and we'll inevitably talk much more about it in Q3 and Q4 as we kind of get into that."

You've hit most of the highlights, your NatWest Markets coming off, the government lending growth. And that -- if I look at the government lending on the CBIL side, it's got about 50% RWA intensity. So it's sometimes more, I think, than people realize in that space. We'll obviously have some more -- one which is going on, obviously, much lower intensity. But in essence, then the balance will be made up with some level of procyclicality that will come through, but we're comfortable with the obvious £185 billion to £195 billion range that we've given you."

We've seen debit and credit cards spending now up 10% on June levels and coming back quite quickly. Actually, cash transactions are still remained very low, but debit and credit cards are going up. We've seen mortgage volumes obviously increasing, which I mentioned, and commercial card and cash transactions have more than doubled by the low point in volume.

And related to that, in the past, you've talked about 80 to 100 bps being a circa 15% ROE, even allowing for pending mortgage risk weight changes. If we look at where front book spreads are to the industry, but we see substantially above that. Could you just give us an update on where you think front book mortgage ROEs are at the moment, I guess, they're up significantly?

You will ensure that you are meeting all of the capital requirements and that the regulator is comfortable with your overall financial position. And that would be -- that's the normal case. And as you know, for the -- for last year, we plan to pay an ordinary and indeed a special, and you may take it that the regulators were content with that. As for where we go from here, however, they have essentially put a block on capital distributions, which includes ordinary specials and buybacks at this point, and they said they will reconsider in the fourth quarter.

Acquisitions have not changed in our priority list. We have very strong client franchises, as you can see in our Personal and Commercial bank. And we see significant opportunities to increase our share closer to our prevailing market share, so opportunity to grow. You have seen that we have made small acquisitions like free agents or looked at mortgage books in the past if we think that they add shareholder value, but let me come back to the point that it's our clear intention and our clear preference to return capital to our shareholders when it is appropriate to do so.

You can -- the math is relatively complicated behind how much you do that. But let's assume you see quite a lot of migration into Stage 3, that's why you lose such a portion of that. And then that would have a benefit of about 20 basis points in terms of your -- sorry, that would have a cost of 20 basis points in terms of your CET1 if you got to that kind of midpoint on your impairment summary.
