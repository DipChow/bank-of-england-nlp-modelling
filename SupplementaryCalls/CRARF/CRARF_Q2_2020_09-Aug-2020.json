Has that had any impact on operations? Or do you expect it to in the future?

It's true that if we don't have to change significantly the scenario, we will have only to update the Bucket 1 and Bucket 2 provisioning with the evolution of the outstandings, so it means the evolution of the amount and also, possibly, the migrations of the loan between Bucket 1 and Bucket 2 or Bucket 2 and Bucket 3. But this quarter, in addition to all these updating, we had to integrate a completely new scenario which is explaining, certainly, a significant part of the increase in Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisioning. So going forward, I expect that the main driver of the evolution of the loan loss provision is going to be the evolution of the impaired loans. And there, we don't have much visibility. The only thing I can tell is that we don't expect a sharp increase in the number of defaults going forward, at least in the very next quarter because simply all the state mechanisms that were here to provide relief and support to the economy are still operating."

The benefit is that we have a capital relief. And it's true that considering our strong capital position, we are very comfortable with the idea of continuing the dismantling of the Switch in connection with the commitments that we had taken for the medium-term plan. So technically, we must wait for the clawback to take place before we can do another layer of dismantling. But considering the very low level actually of triggering that we had end of June, normally, the clawback should come as soon as end of this year."

When I remember your outlook that you gave at the last call for Q1, which was really, really measured, and when I'm hearing the answer to my colleague, Jon, it really seems things are getting better. So even without proxy-ing ourselves to '21 but maybe more '22, do you feel comfortable simply maintaining the targets of the plan as they are looking ahead 18 months? That would be the first question. The second question is really the performance of LCL on net interest income because if I understand well, the sort of like one-off was the dividend on Visa in Q2 2019. So I would take it that instead of going down 3.6%, underlying, the net interest income would have been more or less flat, which is an amazing performance versus competition. So is there any particular explanation for that really, really good performance at LCL?"

It's a base effect that we had in Q2 '19 that we don't have any longer in Q2 '20. Now clearly, the net interest margin at LCL is very resilient but -- because of the commercial dynamics because, as I mentioned, loan outstandings outside state-guaranteed loans are up 7% between June '19 and June '20, so this is definitely producing the same mechanisms as the one we've already mentioned, i.e., net interest margin, which continues to be a little bit under pressure because new loans continue to be booked at a lower rate than the average level of older loans, but a volume effect that is compensating. So all in all, yes, the top line at LCL is quite resilient, but we are of the opinion that this should continue going forward, unless there is something unexpected that takes place."

We are not back at the level we had in June '19, as I mentioned, but the rebound is sharp. There is also, at the same time, some, I would say, a shift in the mix of loans. And we are more and more granting equipment loans rather than pure treasury loans. So it means that we have a smaller margin on these loans but also, going forward, a lower level of risk. And you know that in France, we have the [Foreign Language] rate, which is preventing actually the consumer credit lenders to really tackle with the lower end of the market because the lower end of the market would dissolve rates in order to have a decent risk/reward level. That would not meet the [Foreign Language] rate ceiling. So this is why structurally in France, we have a lower dynamic of consumer credit, and we have the whole French population, which is not de facto eligible to this category of loans. So this is clearly, positively, going forward, going to represent a constraint on the development of consumer credit loans. But on the other hand, again, the development of equipment loans is good, and it's proving to be quite dynamic nowadays. It represented a significant part of the credit demand in June."

And then your last question was about do we continue to grant a new moratorium.

And when we go to 2021, again, on capital returns, if the dividends would be reallowed, so for example, some Italian banks have also continued to say that they want to proceed with payments in euro of the canceled dividends for last year, is this also something that you would be considering continuing? And then I just wanted to ask on the French retail banking. Again, following Jacques-Henri's question, I think it's quite notable also in fees and in net interest income across all revenue lines.

You have it on the table, 12% CET1 ratio at CASA, above 16% at group level so, in both cases, far above the targets, far above the different constraints that we have to respect. So we definitely have -- we are in the capacity of paying our dividend. That's the first point. Second -- and you have the figures in mind. But if CASA had paid its dividend regarding 2019, this would have represented a hit of around 60 or 70 bps on its capital ratio as compared to the level that we have now, so still above 11%. And considering the high retention of results at group level, if Casa pays its dividend at the level it was initially forecast, this would represent around 15 bps at group level considering the retention of 56% of this dividend by the regional banks. So this is the situation. Nevertheless, we are never going to do anything that is not compliant with ECB's regulation. So it's very -- I think, ineffective to try and comment in length the situation. The recommendation is here. It's not really useful to discuss what could be the situation if it was not here. So again, we have the capacity to pay, that's for sure, both at group and at CASA level.

So can you just -- I'm sure you're factoring that somehow, but can you just explain to us a bit how is that weighted in your risk scenarios? And secondly, in Italy, can you comment on how the Intesa-UB consolidation will impact the competition environment, pricing? And do you take -- have to take any management action to correct the trajectory of your growth given this consolidation? And lastly, just coming back on Jean-Francois' question on dividend, I think ECB put in a press release that if any banks can justify some legal obligation to pay a dividend, then it could be looked at. I get your point that there's no point to challenge the ECB recommendation. But is there a case for you that you have to pay a dividend to the parent to support even more the economy and so on.

So the main scenario is described on Page 39. We have also integrated a more favorable scenario and also a less favorable scenario. So we have a whole set of scenario with different weighting of each scenario. And so of course, this scenario, each of them has a narrative. And in certain unfavorable scenario, the narrative is that the different fiscal measures that we await from the government are not efficient enough and that also, this is leading to the fact that the biggest part of the additional savings put aside by the individuals in France are kept and are not spent. So this is integrated in, I would say, the less favorable scenario. The second element is, of course, that as you can see, the scenario -- the central scenario that we've integrated is less favorable than the one we used in Q1 because, obviously, we have seen the situation evolved between the end of Q1 and end of Q2."

But for the time being, what is happening in the reality is exactly what had been forecast by the government and what is clearly the way the government in France but also in the rest of the world were intending to manage this sanitary crisis. So I don't see any reason why we should, for the time being at least, change our views on that.

Could we be entitled to say that we have a legal and binding -- legally binding obligation to pay a dividend from CASA to the regional banks? I don't think it's really a case that we want to open.

Can you just help us a little bit understand what's the benefit that we should expect in terms of net interest income for the second half of this year, I assume in LCL, mainly? And then my last question is on cost of risk. When I look at your Slide 15, we can see from the Stage 3 that there's been some increases, obviously, from low levels.

So clearly, we don't think about M&A because we have an \"excess\" of capital. So clearly, the 2 things are separated. I think that, as we have always said, on a long-term basis so, i.e., besides the present situation, our goal, our target is to distribute half of our earnings to our shareholders and to use the rest of the solvency that we generate in order to develop in a productive manner our different activities. That's clearly the long-term target. So it happens that presently, the dividend policy is under constraint. We are not going to reassess our long-term capital management policy simply because there is, for the time being, and we expect and we hope it's not going to last forever, a constraint on one of the elements that is key in our capital management policy, which is the dividend policy."

So we have this additional tool, which is useful in order to fine-tune, I would say, our capital trajectory, which is the Switch mechanism. And we are committed to go up to at least 50% of dismantling by 2022. So these are, I would say, the key components of our capital management policy.

We try permanently to combine security and, I would say, profitability: security because we want to avoid a situation where we have a liquidity cliff at a certain point in time and profitability because we try permanently to have the cheapest possible way of financing our balance sheet. So clearly, the TLTRO belongs to the tools that can help reduce the cost of our funding. And this is exactly what we had in mind when we decided the level that we have drawn at this window with the idea, of course, that, at the same time, our asset book is going to grow significantly because we are very active to lend to the economy and we have been very active, for example, to develop and to grant state-guaranteed loans. So clearly, the fact that we have drawn this amount to the TLTRO is going to help our P&L going forward.

And the second component of the cost of risk is definitely the Stage 3 provisioning, and this depends vastly on the evolution of our counterparts. What happened in the second quarter, which explains a significant part of the evolution of the Stage 3 provisioning, is the fact that, first point, certain counterparts that were already very fragile before the beginning of the lockdown were so fragile that, actually, they couldn't claim any state-guaranteed loan or equivalent help really defaulted because of the lockdown and so entered into Stage 3. The other elements that we have seen, especially at CACIB, was the fact that certain counterpart that we had across the world proved to be actually a fraudulent counterpart.

Going now to your second question regarding the CET1 target, it's true that actually with this margin above SREP, which stands at 400 -- above 400 bps, we are far above the type of buffer that we would want in the long run to keep above the Pillar 2 requirement. We don't necessarily think that the moment is well chosen to modify the target because, first, of course, this is an issue that needs to be discussed with the ECB. And second, this is an issue that needs to be explained calmly to the market. But theoretically, it's true that all things being equal, the different regulatory requirements have reduced as compared to what they were end of last year by at least 60 bps for CASA.

The first one is what we call balance sheet and holding, and this is the one on which the trend is permanently to do the reduction. So what we expect and what we are working at is to continue to reduce the cost of this bucket. Then there are 2 other buckets which are structural. The first one is all the businesses which do not sit within a dedicated business line, so typically, the real estate business, which is a small real estate development business. We have also the private equity business, and we have some other minor activities, which are structurally inside the Corporate Centre but which may post a certain volatility in their P&L. And clearly, this quarter, they generated a negative P&L because the biggest part of this bucket is made up of private equity activities. And the valuation of the private equity funds that we have there was negatively oriented."

But across the board, on a long-term basis, it's converging towards 0. So the main item which is the one on which we work harder in order to reduce it is what we call balance sheet and holding. And you see that really, this is improving regularly, and we hope and we are working in order to make it continue to reduce. And then there is the last element, which is the volatile part, which I explained rapidly, this can be structurally quite volatile with significantly high or low levels.

And every time we manage to lower the cost of the funding that we still need in the Corporate Centre, we also manage to reduce the overall cost. So these 2 elements are clearly the key drivers. The average cost has been significantly reducing in the last few years and is going to continue to shrink because of market conditions. In terms of volume, it depends on the capacity of upstreaming dividends. So it depends on the profitability of the subsidiaries. And it depends also sometimes on the acquisitions that we have made because, for example, when Amundi acquired Pioneer Investments, Amundi needed the capital increase. We participated in the capital increase at CASA, and so this led us to pay a significant amount so suddenly to increase again the cash-out on this Corporate Centre."

So we expect that at least part of this excess of cash that has been put on the side deposit is going to be used to increase the consumption. But for the time being, we have to wait because, yes, the consumption has significantly increased but compared to the very significant amount of cash that was filed on the side deposits, it's only a small part of this success that has been spent up to now. And it's more or less the same for the Large Customers division and the financing activities because we are here and ready to answer to any request of our customers that need to be financed. But of course, if, at a certain point in time, there is a weaker business sentiment and a lower appetite of our corporate customers to raise financing in order to develop their activities and to invest, we'll have to deal with it. So for the time being, we don't see any slowdown, but we are going to see a slowdown, which is the usual summer slowdown. So we have no sign of deterioration of the business sentiment.

And I'm not pretending that we are going to be able to monitor this business line at a cost-to-income ratio of 43% permanently, but we have been operating the CIB with one of the lowest cost-to-income ratio of all European CIBs in the last few years, and we intend to continue.

So it means that, actually, the protection that is given by the car is bigger actually than in fleet financing.

If I simply take net interest income ex PEL/CEL divided by loans, it's like a marginal decline in the quarter. It's basically not that much different to Q4. Yet you've had the high-volume growth on the deposit side, which is higher than the asset side, including current accounts, up 30%. So that's negative. You've got the state-guaranteed loans, which should be negative. And then you've had lower swap rates, which are also negative. So how is net interest margin is so stable? If you can maybe just give us some more color. And then secondly, could you just discuss GAC Sofinco specifically, please? Because, I guess, that business is like 2 to 3 months ahead of the rest, how do you call it, of consumer finance in navigating the crisis given where China is, and it's a different market. But like, how recovered is that? Is it basically back to a normal run rate of the top line in asset quality?

There has been an effort at LCL in order to develop further, first, consumer credit loans; and second, the SME and professional loans which generally have a better customer rate than home loans.

So we're having a pickup in GAC Sofinco.

I think if you back out the minority interest in consumer from the tax benefit at Agos, it seems as if the underlying business of Agos was basically breakeven in the second quarter. Is that a fair estimate? And also, it looks like the equity income from the joint ventures is holding up relatively well compared to what's happening in the consolidated loan book.

So it means that CACEIS, for example, or Crédit Agricole Italia or, even more obviously, Amundi couldn't upstream the dividend this year. So it's a mix of different situations with which we had to deal. In the consumer credit business, let me start with the equity accounted entities. Yes, of course, they all apply the same type of methodologies that we use in order to evaluate the IFRS 9 provisioning because you know that, in all cases, we have the management of the support and risk functions.

And there is also mainly another traditional consumer credit business which is Wafasalaf in Morocco, and Wafasalaf has had a significant increase in its cost of risk. And this led to a decrease in its contribution to the equity accounted entities. So the minus 22.7% that we had leading to the €60 million contribution is a mix between a good performance coming from the car financing entities and a weaker one coming from the Wafasalaf entity. If -- if I really -- I'm going to check that I really understood your -- the other part of your question.

And so it means that for 1.5 or 2 months' time, they have not been or almost not been any physical collection on payment incidents in Italy. So it's clear that we have had, probably this quarter at Agos, an extra amount of provisioning led or triggered by this impossibility of collecting physically the repayments on the loans. So we need to wait until the situation is completely normalized in order to check whether this is a real incident, payment incident, or whether simply, the simple fact, that the collection can take place again is triggering the regularization of the loan.

I think you said clients were paying around 0 for the loans. If you can fund yourself at 100 basis points below, using the TLTRO 3 as your marginal funding source, does that mean that you're earning a percentage point of interest margin net on these volumes? Or am I missing something? In which case, please tell me where I'm going wrong there. And then next question on the tax rate. Was there anything else this quarter that led to the low tax rate because the affrancamento, €39 million, would seem to only be explaining part of the reason that it's so low. So anything going on there? And then finally, on rating migration within risk-weighted assets, do you have any expectations there for headwinds in coming quarters? Or do you think it's not really an important effect for you? Or if it happens, would that be a next year effect, kind of timed with the end of government support measures? Just any thoughts there on -- in terms of magnitude or timing?"

    "text": "Okay. So on state-guaranteed loans, the rate is 0, and the borrower has simply to pay a premium which is the price of the state -- of the guarantee. So for the first year, this premium is set, I would say, at a flat rate of 25 bps, and this 25 bps is split 90% for the state and 10% for the bank, which is keeping the premium on its own part of the risk taking. Then -- so it means that for the loan itself, outside the guarantee, the rate is indeed 0. It's 0. So of course, if we were able to say that we are marginally financing a specific state-guaranteed loan with a specific drawing on the TLTRO, we could say that we are going to trigger and to book a net margin of 1 percentage point. But actually, again, what we do is that we manage globally the balance sheet and the balance sheet is moving permanently, especially in these present circumstances where we have had many, many changes in the behavior of customers. So to put it differently, the TLTRO is going to help decrease a little bit the average -- the weighted average cost of the funding of our balance sheet. But at the same time, the state-guaranteed loans are not going to help boost the average -- the weighted average yield of the assets that we have on our balance sheet."

Rating migration, well, we regularly review the rating of our different counterparts. We have to do it regularly. And of course, every time the credit quality of a counterpart deteriorates, we have to downgrade its rating in our system, and this is triggering an increase in the level of RWAs. On this quarter alone, this led to close to €2 billion increase in RWAs at CACIB. So it's not nothing. It's not nothing, definitely. And possibly, it can continue going forward. So this rating migration effect is part of the more global set of elements that trigger modification in the level of RWAs.

The AT1 coupons which are tax deductible, but they do not play a massive role this quarter because it's not completely spread regularly across the different quarters. And if I remember correctly, it was not a very significant amount this quarter. And then we have also the fact that some of our profits in different businesses are booked in geographies where the tax rate, corporate tax rate, is lower than in France.

So it means that every time there is a tax dispute that is settled, generally, it is settled with a lower cost than the one we had initially booked, and so it means that we can have on a specific quarter some reversal of tax provisions that benefit to the average tax rate. And so there have been some bits and pieces of elements like that this quarter across the board. So this is leading to the provisional, I would say, tax rate of the quarter because you know that when it comes to taxes, the reality really takes place at the end of the year."

There is just this huge €77 million recovery on the financing business, just to have an idea of what it is. And the second question, what is quite interesting about the performance of the division is Wealth Management, which is doing extremely well, which has almost doubled its profitability versus last year. So again, is it a base from which we can actually work on? And are you comfortable about the return on net equity for 2022 which for this division is, I think, 25% and would correspond to a doubling of current profitability? And lastly, I would be delighted to join the insurance one-on-one pitch-in between Pierre and Emilie."

Actually, we had reached earlier, beginning of '19 or even end of '18, a low level of profitability. So Jacques Prost, the head of the business, is working on improving the cost efficiency, on improving the revenue-generation capacity. And so we expect globally the trend to continue. Of course, there can be some ups and downs on a quarterly basis. The first quarter was very good revenue-wise. The second quarter was a little bit weaker from a revenue point of view. But it was better also from a tax point of view, to go back to this point. And so all in all, the bottom line improved, but it's not there yet in terms of profitability target. Globally, your second question on the tax rate..."

So you seem quite confident about the mortgage volume outlook at LCL in the second half of the year. However, the [Foreign Language] estimates now that mortgage production levels in France should fall by 26% in 2020 if the country's GDP declined by 10% this year, which is, I think, your main assumption. So I'd just like to understand what makes you confident the LCL could maintain good mortgage volume growth in the second half of the year in such a market context."

    "text": "Well, I said I was confident about LCL. I didn't specifically say I was confident about the capacity of LCL to grow the home loan volumes. So globally, the business of LCL is behaving quite well. But of course, if there is a certain downturn on the evolution of the home loan market, it's going to be also felt at LCL. But as I said earlier, LCL tried to diversify a little bit the breakdown of its different categories of lending by increasing the corporate volumes, by increasing the consumer credit loans, too, and the loans also aiming at professionals. So what is going to be important for us globally for LCL is the capacity of keeping a good dynamic of loans globally, not only home loans, and also a good dynamic on the sale of other products and services, so not only lending because the key of the business, the retail banking business, in France is really to be able to continue to develop the whole set of activities around the customers. So I agree that there might be a slowdown in the home loan business, but LCL does not rely only on this business."
