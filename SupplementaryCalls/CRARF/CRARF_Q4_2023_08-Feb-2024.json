A continuation of what we have already seen or any change. And then secondly, if I look at the revenue trajectory on slide eight, I think, of course, there has been some very solid growth.

Are there any elements in 2024 that get you to think that we can ease from that level of 3.7? And then the second question, a small detail, but on the RWA slide you highlight, plus â‚¬2.9 billion on corporate center due to some FX impact.

Can you remind us your retail market share in the country and whether you've been happy with the way it has evolved over the recent past? So those are my two questions. Thank you very much."

So in in Italy, what we've seen in the last quarter was that, of course, the revenues were up globally for CrÃ©dit Agricole Italia, if you can just show the page, revenues were up 4.4%. And the net interest margin was a little bit down between Q3 and Q4. So exactly what we've been saying already between Q2 and Q3, i.e., we have more or less reached some kind of a plateau in terms of NII in Italy, because rates have stabilized and even started to decrease a little bit if we talk about long term rates."

Of course, the same assumption for the future revolution of feds applies as for LCL. In terms of the development in the country, the last significant operation that we made was the acquisition of Creval inorganic growth operation."
