I would even say that most of the DAX CEOs, but a lot of also the German family-owned companies, actually have signaled the cautious optimism.

Yes, we have seen some repayments of the initial drawdowns from end of March, but overall, I would say, compared to eight weeks ago, quite a far more positive picture, though, obviously, most of my colleagues are obviously managing their company quite technically these days because there is uncertainty left."

First of all, on your profitability outlook for the year, potentially, we can put this a little bit into perspective. We started the largest transformation of Deutsche Bank over the last 20 years last year. We always said that we will have one-and-a-half years or six really key quarters where we do most of the restructuring. We have the restructuring costs. You have seen that 75% of our transformation costs have now been kind of done already. And we also said at the beginning of the year, pre-COVID, that our ambition is not only the €19.5 billion goal in terms of costs, but that we are pretax breakeven."

That actually makes us very confident that also in the second half of 2020, we will show revenues also in the Investment Bank, which are higher than in the second half of 2019 and that the underlying flow is not something which is only done because of COVID, but really which is evidencing the strength of Deutsche Bank."

And we've outlined that the COVID related sort of excess credit loss provisions have run sort of €600 million, €700 million, the first of which will not repeat and the second of which we expect to abate. So, it gives you room to have the outperformance, if you like, in the Investment Bank retrace somewhat while preserving a path to profitability.

And then, you kind of thought the provisions may normalize even further kind of 2021. There is for a moment that absence of additional kind of model changes on profit as well. But how do you think about 2021? We are likely to see some of those tremendous support programs, the furlough programs, the short-term insurance kind of programs actually rolling off. And also, some of the underpaying to a corporate side as well. Does that worry you that, in 2021, we are likely to actually see what the real damage of what we've just gone through is actually looking like? Thank you."

All of us, the industry do. The starting point is the end of the moratoria and the possibility that that creates a cliff. At this point, we don't see that cliff, but it's certainly a possibility. We do see the positive effects of fiscal and monetary support. And as that wanes, obviously, the hope and expectation is that underlying economic performance picks up, but there's a trajectory of GDP growth that means that households and corporates essentially were bridged through a very sharp recession by government action.

It's not only the merger of the PFK with the Deutsche Bank AG, which obviously brings synergies in headcount, but in central costs, but also the merger of the Private Banking international business with the wealth management business is from, a cost point of view, a very efficient one, but also actually gives us chances to further grow and to also offer to our Private Banking clients more what we, for instance, see in the wealth management."

And first of all, just going back to the revenue outlook, sorry to sort of labor the point again, but impressive on the one sense, you're sticking to the 2022 goal and we talked a lot about the expectations for the Investment Bank. I guess, if we look outside of the Investment Bank, we've obviously got a declining revenue picture still in the three other divisions. And I just want to make sure I've got the right takeaway from the call. It seems to me that what you're basically saying is there's a lot of stuff under the bonnet, which maybe we need to look at in terms of loan growth, client interaction stats, fund inflow, those sorts of metrics which aren't yet evidence in the revenue performance. So, the question is, is that the right way to be thinking about your sort of indication that obviously we're going to see an improvement from the declining picture we're currently seeing in those divisions?"

And if you take that out, if you look at the volume drivers now after the reopening of the economy in Germany, and I think we talked to that also in the prepared remarks, we can see actually that the volume is above 2019 level, be it on the investment side or be it on the credit growth and lending growth side, which is a good indicator that actually the underlying business is working well."

Do you believe, for example, the Investment Bank can continue at that level of revenues that you're illustrating over the last four quarters as a runway to get the additional 2% from the other divisions?
