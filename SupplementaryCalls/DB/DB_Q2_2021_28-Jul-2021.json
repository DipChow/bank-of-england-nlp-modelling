And how the recent curve developments have been incorporated into your planning, if at all? And then secondly, the 8% return target has remained flat. So when I factor in the bump in revenues and moderate provision somewhat, I would get to an increase in your RoTE target even after adjusting for the rising costs. So is there some one-offs or something we should be considering? So any commentary around that would be great."

But you also see the supervisors are remaining pretty cautious on credit risk too. So what gives you the confidence on moving guidance already?"

To your revenue question, let me go through the building blocks as you're saying, and I'm doing it business by business. But overall, our confidence in higher revenues, Tom, really goes back to the positive development, which we have not only seen now for the last quarter or the first quarter, but actually for the last 4 quarters in all 4 core businesses. And what we can do is that we can go back to our 4 business and compare our 2022 revenue targets, which we outlined at the IDD in December, and compare this now with our view after the first 6 months, but also after looking at the transformation over the last 12 to 18 months."

In Asia, it is more capital markets oriented, very successful growing. But in Europe, it goes to the point which James made in his previous response, that we are actually very well placed in particular in those countries where we have Corporate Banking activities, Wealth Management and Private Banking activities that we are seen as the bank for entrepreneurs. And hence, we see a very nice line of growth in Italy, in Spain, also in Germany, where we can play this card, that we have the corporate banking exposure."

At this point, the step off would be last year's end balance sheet. There, by the way, you'll see a fair amount of the benefit in CRU because that deleveraging will then be reflected in its allocation of the SRF."
