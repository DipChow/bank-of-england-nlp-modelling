It's obviously never going to be 100% of the book based on thresholds and other things that we apply to clients.

Now looking again at the Investment Bank, and I think now we are a little bit overestimating the impact, for instance, of the absolutely well-run SPAC business in Q1, but if you take it as an overall percentage of the total IB revenues, that business will not make or break the IB run in 2022. So we have a very strong underlying business in the FIC, in the credit business and also as we, in our view, have such a strong momentum in the client engagement Origination & Advisory that we simply think it's two years running above €9 billion of revenues."

Obviously, Q1 was weighted more towards credit, both credit trading and financing, than is typical. And it also is -- it was particularly sort of impactful in the year-on-year comparison in the quarter. So without in any way diminishing what we think was good relative performance in rates, FX and emerging markets, the quarter was defined by a strong credit performance. The mix going forward is, as I say, hard to judge."

So you get to places where each of the businesses is performing in line with its market opportunity driven by volatility, driven by client activity, driven by the mix of structured versus flow business. But seeing the interaction then as the mix develops, you do get some comfort about the trend and the direction of travel, even as the mix can be a little bit unpredictable from quarter-to-quarter. And of course, the year-on-year comparisons can move from quarter-to-quarter."

I just wanted to ask, if you can give us a bit of an update in terms of how you're thinking it. At 33%, when are you considering adding a buyback to it, we expect this for full year results or what the overall mix is? And then also, probably acquisitions."

And so as I mentioned, the dividend accrual is mechanical based on a rule, but the nice thing is to exit the first quarter with the €300 million sort of on the books represents a €0.15 dividend just on that, if it were all to come out in dividend. I think that gives us some flexibility as we think to the -- both the size and the mix of the distribution that we intend to start next year. But it's too early to say, as I say, on both size and mix, but we're pleased that we've set a milestone here."

We have half time, and we need to keep the focus into the discipline. There is lots to do on everything, be it revenues, be it cost. So we are fully focused on that. And we certainly believe, and fortunately, we have seen that over the last 12 months with each quarter where we perform, we get better also in relative terms, and that is then the right basis for any other discussion."
