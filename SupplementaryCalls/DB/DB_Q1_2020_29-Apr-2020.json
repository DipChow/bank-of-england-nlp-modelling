So, first of all, the EU package announced yesterday, just to quantify the impact for us, we would see that as - and this by the way would be a conservative estimate, as delivering, say 20 basis points to 30 basis points into our CET1 ratio. The largest part of that would be the treatment of software intangibles. And I think we've talked about that, in the past that that's a significant drag for us or deduction in our ratio. It's about 80% today, or 80 basis points, I'm sorry, in our ratio today."

But I got the sense if we continue the presentation by giving some pretty strong assurances on the outlook for credit losses, and then the outlook for revenues as well. I'd just like to take a step back and ask a broader question. So, you have been in European banking for a long period of time. How likely is it in your mind that the nonperforming loan formation and the credit loss cycle this time around, will be better than what you've seen in 2008 and '09 and '11 and '12?

Now, first of all, I do believe actually that, and I think I can speak for most of the banks, but obviously best for Deutsche Bank, we will see less lowness provisions then in the crisis of 2008 for three reasons. Number one, in particular in Germany, the program which has been done and the umbrella which has been provided by the government is far stronger, because it actually contains two elements. Number one, immediate liquidity support. Number two, there are programs in place, which actually already addresses the long-term solvency questions of corporates."

When I look at the structure of the portfolio, you have seen James references, but also my slide, with regard to concentration risk, with regard to active hedging, with regard to trying to actually allocating the risk out, we are doing a far better job. And in this regard, I do believe that the three items plus the healthier balance sheet of banks to absorb losses is a major difference, at least for Deutsche Bank.

And weâ€™re talking at this point about 35 basis points to 45 basis points this year. And there is also an ECB add-on to that number, so that goes beyond what we calculate our provisions to be - the ECB add-on represents 10%, 12% on top. So some real differences."

The stress tests essentially assume that management does nothing to manage sort of credit outcomes or the portfolio. So it takes what I would call a static balance sheet. And that's also clearly not a real world scenario, so a lot of differences. We're obviously alive to the comparison, but we think again, looking at our detailed modeling, they're very good reasons to see this as quite different in terms of likely outcome relative to that stress test."

To be very honest, from various items, number one, we have achieved now for nine quarters our costs target. And that tells you that we have full discipline, full control and a management visibility into comp cost but also non-comp costs, which was simply not available 24 months ago. So, the work finance has done in order to allow deep dives to find where additional cost savings are, is brilliant and helps us actually to navigate, that's number one."

We said that in the first phase of this crisis where everybody was personally affected, we don't want to communicate, for that time, additional individual layoffs. We started that end of March, beginning of April, and we are now actively reviewing when we are actually regaining that, because with the lifting of the restrictions in the regions also here in the home country, where a lot of restructuring is done, we will also resume that. We are committed to this transformation and the restructuring."

If we look at our travel costs, if we look at our entertainment costs, if we look at the real estate costs, all this is underway. Therefore, we have a Chief Transformation Officer who is doing nothing else, and looking at the chances and opportunities of that what we have experienced over the last four weeks, and actually thinking about what can we implement now long-term and that will also result in cost reductions. And that, combined with the track record this Management Board has built makes us confident to achieve the â‚¬19.5 billion or even be better than that."

It is interesting that this crisis came upon the industry at a point in time where U.S. GAAP filers switching to CECL.

And a big starting point is, does the bank have a credit card portfolio? For us, our consumer unsecured is a relatively small part of the book overall. And so, I think it's entirely natural that you'd expect significant differences in the total provision level that we would take relative to some of our peers."

So rather than looking at P&L provisions, look at where banks have ended up in terms of their allowance for loan losses or their allowance for credit losses against the portfolio. And interestingly there, you would actually see us pretty well in line with a number of our peers, once you exclude the credit card portfolios. Suggesting in a way that if our underlying portfolio is in fact less risky as we think it is than at least some of the comparables, our allowance is in fact on a relative basis, at least in line if not relatively more conservative."
