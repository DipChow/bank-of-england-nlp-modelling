It's clearly been another strong quarter, including some outperformance against peers. The market conditions are unusually supportive, and consensus looks like it's anticipating something like a 20% to 25% decline in the FIC revenue pool by 2023 compared to what we've seen over the last 4 quarters. And applying that to Deutsche Bank would suggest something like a â‚¬1.5 billion revenue headwind in the FIC business. So I'd be interested in your thoughts on the market outlook, how much share you've regained so far and also your aspirations for further franchise strengthening."

Everything else, at this point, we would probably say is plus or minus 10 basis points in the ratio.

So we talk about that. It tends to be in a range between, say, â‚¬0 and â‚¬100 million in revenues per quarter.

But by and large, you're looking at a stable revenue base, perhaps a little bit below where we were in the third quarter and it can be influenced up by these episodic revenues. And that's before some of the drivers of growth that Christian talked about earlier. So obviously, we're fighting through the headwinds from interest rates in that business, particularly, by the way, U.S. dollar rates this year in 2020. So when we talk about a minus 2x FX, we think of that as strong performance given that now we've battled through really 2 set rounds of U.S. dollar rate declines. And really, the U.S. dollar impact is pretty much built into our run rate now in the third quarter. So year-on-year, next year, there's probably a little more to come given that, that rate move hadn't taken place in the first quarter. But on a run rate basis in the second and third quarters, it's largely filtered through the U.S. dollar piece. I hope that helps."

We are seeking to put as much of that behind us as quickly as possible. And as I indicated, there may be higher restructuring and severance. We're actually at, at this point, the restructuring severance that we initially called for, for the full year. And we do expect more restructuring and severance in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure exactly where that would run but in a ballpark, perhaps â‚¬200 million in the fourth quarter. And as we go through our planning this year, we're going to see and then update you how much of that is pull forward from '21, how much of that will be ultimately incremental to what we've guided to.

    "text": "First, well done on the FIC revenues, much better than I thought you'd do in Q3. Given these very strong FIC results of â‚¬350 million and the ongoing high level of macro uncertainty, I guess I'm surprised you felt the need to release â‚¬135 million of Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions. As an outsider, I'd have thought the prudent thing to do would have been to recycle a much better FIC revenues into stronger provision coverage. So I guess my first question is why did you choose not to do that?"

    "text": "Stuart, it's James. On the CLPs, look, I'd say two things. One is the ECL for Stages 1 and 2, we follow the model. And so that gives us insight into what the release should be based on the model. We did, as we mentioned, execute a management adjustment or an overlay to the conservative to, if you like, restrain what the model result would have been. I don't see it as necessarily corresponding to the revenue environment. If you do that, it is -- it's not, frankly, following the accounting standards. We think we've built the appropriate provision, it's prudent with a management overlay and something that reflects the outlook and all of the information that we had at that time."

We think the trajectory there is manageable. I don't actually have the immediate Stage 3 numbers for you in that portfolio, which we can follow up on. But I can say more broadly, we're seeing small numbers of defaults over time."

Take care and see you soon."
