I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on that because -- the second quarter was actually pretty strong. And last year prior periods were also very strong on a relative basis. So yes, I would just like to know what gives you that confidence. Is it just a simple kind of maybe the credit side of things or increasing a little bit more into the back end of the year?"

But because we find ourselves now on the other side of the cycle, increasing volatility as investors now begin to position for an uncertain path in terms of reducing policy rates and an uncertain path in terms of the length of time the policy rates stay at the terminal rate.

I know that you communicated a 70 basis point impact from Numis deal closing the share buyback and some of the regulatory melanges. I think Christian mentioned securitization and reduction in software lending potentially resulting also in some RB reduction. Could you perhaps quantify that?"

Is that entirely driven by you? And if so, when do you expect the turnaround on that front?"

And then 9 basis points for Numis, 12 basis points for the capital return. The other moving parts are organic capital generation and how much we use in terms of balance sheet growth, that should produce a year-end ratio probably higher than our original guidance for the year."

Some of the lower loan growth or even decline is intentionally, by the way, not only from a risk management point of view because we have actually a very conservative and long-standing risk appetite, and therefore, we don't need to do so many adjustments in between. But of course, also we have sub hurdle relationships where we -- and we said that in April, where we want to go for an even better and more focused risk return strategy, and that's what we are doing.

We completely changed the way we are managing credit risk also for medium and family-owned corporates when it comes to concentration risk when it comes to differentiating between, sort of, say, winners and potential companies which are more challenged in certain industries, we have a clear industry view and not only the specific company view.
