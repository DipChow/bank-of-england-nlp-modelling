Let me start actually on the journey in 2024 because it really builds up nicely then to the 2025 story. And it starts really with this good Q1, in my view, across all businesses. And if we now look how the business is progressing, then you can really see that the stable businesses, i.e., the corporate bank, the private bank and asset management that what we have seen in Q1 is actually a good number you can have in your mind also for the following quarters. And one item, which is positive for us, and James can give you some further details is that the NII is actually behaving even better than we thought and that what we have given you earlier this year."

And on the fee-generating side, we are actually succeeding there where we wanted to succeed and where the investments are now paying off. You have seen the market share gain in the origination and advisory business. We gained market share by 70 basis points. We have shown a €500 million revenues in O&A this quarter. To be honest, it's a number which I would also see based on the mandates for Q2, always hard to then go for Q3 and Q4. But with the investments we have done in people but also in Numis, I think that, again, Q1 is a very good marker in the O&A business."

We have now for quarters and quarters, gathered assets under management like in Q1 in PB and in Asset Management. And that obviously is driving further revenues there. So the NII tailwind and the benefits from the assets under management growth is driving further the Private Banking revenues in '25 versus '24. Then in the Corporate Bank, actually, there is no NII headwind anymore in '25 versus '24, but we are benefiting from all the mandates which we are getting actually, not only here in Germany, but globally. You have seen in the script, actually, how also in Q1 versus Q1 last year, we actually increased our mandates, which we won with multinational corporates, and that is, again, a momentum, which I can see going forward."

We always said that with the investments, which we have done, we want to gain 1% market share. We have done 0.7% in Q1, but there is more to come. And I also do believe that in particular, in the O&A market, there is a further recovery. We can see the momentum in the M&A market, in the ECM market, it is starting, but it's not there where I can see the fee pool is in '25."

They've run high for the past several years, but we are -- we really think at the tail end of the work we need to do in terms of restructuring and severance, the litigation profile that we've talked about in the past. So I'd love to see that sort of in and around €300 million to €400 million in total next year, which would obviously imply a run -- an operating cost level in the high 19s. On a run rate basis, that means we need to be taking expenses down by, say, €50 million to €100 million per quarter next year to achieve our numbers."

So the simple version of what's still to be done, it's still day-to-day execution on the glide path of those measures, whether that's branch closures, app decommissioning, headcount reductions, process simplification, front to back on data, all of the things that we've been talking about for some time now are on a glide path for delivery, and we're confident that we're set up to achieve the goals we laid out for this year and next."

Often that includes terms, new equity, sometimes sort of concessions from the banks, and that's as it should be. I don't think of it as a giant extend and pretend process, but a healthy process of managing these assets through a cycle, you should expect the modifications to continue to rise.

You've had a lot of inflows and yet your revenues in the first quarter haven't really moved much. So if I kind of look at your guidance for the division, it would seem you're expecting quite a bit of a pickup over the next 9 months. So I suppose what is driving that relative to the first quarter?"

I mean, look, it's been a major source of growth for you, but also your peers, I'm just curious about what's driving that kind of growth differential kind of versus pre-COVID levels and how sustainable that is? Because I suppose if I look at the leverage consumption of the IB, it's gone up considerably over the last 4 years. So maybe if you could provide a sense of kind of the margins of that business or the capital intensity, that would also be great."

So as we build balances we build activity. You've seen a year-on-year growth rate of 2%, but now at a level in the first quarter that significantly exceeds any quarter last year, especially the second, third and fourth. And so we think that, that's going to continue to build on itself and create sort of more and more year-on-year differential."

As you can see, market risk RWA relatively modest for us, so it is principally credit risk RWA, both in the balance sheet and derivative businesses."

And the same is true of leverage exposure where we manage to the constraints of our balance sheet but work to optimize how we deploy that leverage exposure to support clients as well as the revenue profile. Sometimes, by the way, the business you do is leverage exposure intensive, but not RWA-intensive and sometimes the opposite. And hence, the optimization efforts that we go to there are considerable and sophisticated. So I would stop there. I don't know if you want to add that thing."

Always hard to say, therefore, what the pretax profit impact is going to be.
